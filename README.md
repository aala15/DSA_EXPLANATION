# DSA-Explanaition
in different python files you can find different ML methods in which we try to extract explanaitions.
in the first step we tried to extract different histograms in order to find a ground truth. (manual_explanaitions)+evaluation
DT-On-Shuttle: the main result of the project. you can find the RFC and DT and the way that we convert the explanaitions to semantically meaningful explanaitions. +evaluation
SVM-On-Shuttle: operating linear SVM on the data set and the way that we extract and compare the results to our manual Explanaitions.+evaluation (in order to avoid applying the SVM again on the dataSet you can just use coefff files which contains the coefficient of each attributes after applying SVM.
macrobase: evaluating the macroBase generated expressions on shuttle.
kdd:is applying DT on KDD and evaluation
macrobase_kdd: is evaluation of macrobase's expressions on KDD data set.
